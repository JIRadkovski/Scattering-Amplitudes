# Scattering-Amplitudes
Mathematica file with computations of scattering amplitudes in Horava Gravity
The notebook is divided into two parts. First containing the code with computation of all the vertices, propagators and diagrams (with gauge invariance check).
The second part has the explicit check of dissapearance of lambda for g g to g g scattering and computations for a head-on collision.
